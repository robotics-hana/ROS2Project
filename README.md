# ROS2Project
 The objective of this project is to create a ROS2 package that will  create and plot cubic trajectories connecting pairs of randomly generated points.  Users should be able to install the package and after running a single launch file they  should see cubic trajectories appearing on the rqt_plot GUI every 10 seconds.
